# Machine learning project about Handwritten Learning recognition

This paper serves as a project report for the course Machine  Learning  by  University  of  Groningen.  This  projectâ€™saim  is  to  tackle  the  task  of  classifying  handwritten  digits.  We present two  approaches to solve  this  problem. First one,  we usea simple linear classifier provided by the code basicDemo.m witha  small  modification,  which  give  an  validation  error  rate  of  7.5%.  For  the  second  approach  we  use  neural networks  using  thedropout regularization of 0.35, obtained a validation error rate of 2 %. Using convolution neural network on test set, we reportedan accuracy of 70  %.
